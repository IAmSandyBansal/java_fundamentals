# Variables

Variables are used to store data or values that can be referenced and manipulated throughout a program.

example:

```java
String welcomeMsg = "Hello World!";
```

- The keyword `String` declares a variable that can store a **sequence of characters** (text).
- `welcomeMsg` is the name of the variable, also called an `identifier`.
- The = sign is the **assignment operator**; it assigns the value on the right side ("Hello World!") to the variable on the left (`welcomeMsg`).

# Types

Types define the kind of data that can be stored in a variable. **Java is a strongly-typed language**, **meaning every variable must be declared with a type before it is used**. 
Java has two main categories of data types:

## Primitive Data Types

## Reference Types
